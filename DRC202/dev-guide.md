About Txid: txid is a blob type, it is the key of a transaction record. if your txid is a nat type or other type, it needs to be converted to a blob type.

## 1. Developing a Token in Motoko

If you are a Motoko developer developing a token, e.g. DRC20, DIP20, ICRC1 standard tokens, you can integrate DRC202 into your token using the `DRC202 Module`, example: https://github.com/iclighthouse/DRC_standards/blob/main/DRC202/examples/ICLighthouse/Example/Example.mo   

If you are developing a Dapp with Motoko and just need to query the transaction records, refer to the `How to query transaction records` section below.

## 2. Developing a Token in Rust

If you are a Rust developer developing a token, such as DRC20, DIP20, ICRC1 standard tokens, you can call DRC202Root, DRC202Proxy and DRC202Bucket APIs to implement it. 

**Storage of transaction records from your Token to DRC202 Cansiter**

- Query storage fee

    When you call the storeBatch/storeBytesBatch method of DRC202Proxy, you need to pay the fee in Cycles and pay once for permanent storage. The `dRC202Proxy.fee()` method allows you to query the storage cost `fee` per record.

- Storing records using DRC202 TxnRecord type

    If you convert the transaction records to DRC202 TxnRecord type, you can call the `DRC202Proxy.storeBatch()` method for batch storage.
    ```
    storeBatch: (_txns: vec TxnRecord) -> ();
    ```
    Note: Calling this method requires adding `size(_txns) * fee` Cycles as a fee. To prevent overloading of DRC202, you need to call it only once at 20 second intervals. Please cache the records locally and call this method at intervals for batch storage.

- Storing records using custom type (Not recommended)

    If you are using custom types for your transaction records, you need to convert the records to Bytes (vec nat8) format first and then call the `DRC202Proxy.storeBytesBatch()` method for batch storage.
    ```
    storeBytesBatch: (_txns: vec record { Txid; vec nat8 }) -> ();
    ```
    Note: Calling this method requires adding `size(_txns) * fee` Cycles as a fee. To prevent overloading of DRC202, you need to call it only once at 20 second intervals. Please cache the records locally and call this method at intervals for batch storage.

**Query transaction records from DRC202 Cansiter**

If you need to query Token's transaction records in canister, refer to the `How to query transaction records` section below.

## 3. Implement interface in Token for IChouse Explorer

```
/// returns DRC202Proxy canister-id
drc202_canisterId: () -> (principal) query;
/// returns events. Address (Text type) is Principal or AccountId. If Address is not specified means to query all latest transaction records.
drc202_events: (opt Address) -> (vec TxnRecord) query;
/// returns events. Filters and returns the records from start `Time` to end `Time`.
drc202_events_filter: (opt Address, opt Time, opt Time) -> (vec TxnRecord, bool) query;
/// returns txn record. Query txn record in token canister cache.
drc202_txn: (Txid) -> (opt TxnRecord) query;
```

## 4. How to query transaction records

Whether you are a Rust, Motoko, or front-end developer, you need to provide the token's canister-id and txid, index or accountId if you want to query the transaction records in DRC202.   
DRC202Root did: https://github.com/iclighthouse/DRC_standards/tree/main/DRC202/DRC202Root.did   
DRC202Proxy did: https://github.com/iclighthouse/DRC_standards/tree/main/DRC202/DRC202Proxy.did   
DRC202Bucket did: https://github.com/iclighthouse/DRC_standards/tree/main/DRC202/DRC202Bucket.did   

- Motoko Developers

    Use the get()/getEvents() method of the `DRC202 Module` to query the local cache of recent transaction records, and use the get2() method to query both cached and archived records.

- For all developers

    1. **Method 1**

    Querying transaction records by Token with DRC202 implemented:.
    - drc202_events(), drc202_events_filter, drc202_txn(): Queries the latest transaction history of the current Dex cached.
    - drc202_txn2(), drc202_archived_txns(), drc202_archived_account_txns(): Queries the transaction history of the external Canister archives.

    2. **Method 2**

    Query the transaction records through the composite_query methods provided by DRC202Root:
    - getArchivedTxn(), getArchivedTxnByIndex(), getArchivedDexTxns(), getArchivedAccountTxns().
    - If custom types are used, use getArchivedTxnBytes().

    3. **Method 3**

    **Step 1**. Get the bucket canister-id where the transaction record is stored by querying DRC202Proxy

    Call `DRC202Proxy.bucket()` or `DRC202Proxy.bucketByIndex()` method to get the Bucket canister-id where the record is stored, if it returns `[]` means the record does not exist.  
    Note: If the return value contains more than one Bucket, it means that the transaction record may exist in one of the Buckets, which is the case due to the BloomFilter technology.

    **Step 2**. Query the transaction record via DRC202Bucket

    1) If this token uses the DRC202 TxnRecord type, call `DRC202Bucket.txn()`, `DRC202Bucket.txnHistory()`, `DRC202Bucket. txnByIndex()` or `DRC202Bucket.txnByAccountId()` methods to query the record.

    2) If this token uses a custom type, call the `DRC202Bucket.txnBytes()` or `DRC202Bucket.txnBytesHistory()` method to query the record based on the Bucket canister-id obtained in the previous step.
