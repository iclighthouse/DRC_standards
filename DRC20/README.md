## Abstract
A standard interface for Dfinity tokens. The standard complies with ERC20 interface specification, and has some improvements to match IC network features.

## Improvements

* Compatible with Principal and Account-id as Address, sub-account supported

* Using the pub/sub model for message notifications

* Improving transaction atomicity with a lock/execute two-phase transfer structure

* Scalability of transaction records storage, temporary storage in token canister and permanent storage in external canisters

* Gas mechanism to preventing DDos attack

* Compatibility with different token standards using the [CTSNC](https://github.com/iclighthouse/DRC_standards/tree/main/CTSNC) specification

## Features

* Immutability

* Scalability

* Improved atomicity

* Idempotency

* Governability

* Compatibility
